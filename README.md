# Binding Energy Model Project
 This project is a computation of the coefficients of the nuclear binding energy formula proposed in the semi-emperical-mass-formula for binding energy. The coefficients were found using gradient descent and the 4000 experiemntally measured binding energies of nuclei as training data.
