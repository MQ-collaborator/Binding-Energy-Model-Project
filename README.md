# Binding Energy Model Project
 This project is a computation of the coefficients of the nuclear binding energy formula proposed in the semi-emperical-mass-formula for binding energy. The coefficients were found using gradient descent and the 4000 experiemntally measured binding energies of nuclei as training data. 
Below is detailed documentation of the problem solved and methodology used:

# Problem
## Explaining Binding Energy
For all atomic nuclei, the mass of the nucleus is less than the mass of the separated nucleons within the nucleus. This difference in mass is known as the mass defect.
